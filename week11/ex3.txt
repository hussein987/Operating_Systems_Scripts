program1:

output:
Hello
Hello

1. parent process copies 'hello' into the buffer.
2. a new process(child) is forked.
3. child process and parent have the same contents in their buffers.
4. child prints a new line and therefore its buffer will be written to the stdout.
6. parent adds a new line to its buffer.
7. the newline flushes 'Hello', then 'Hello' is printed to the stdout.
8. Therefore 'Hello' will be printed twice.

program2:

output:
Hello
\n
\n

1. parent copies 'Hello' to the buffer and appears in the stdout because of the newline.
2. new process(child) is forked.
3. '\n' is written to the stdout from both the child and the parent
