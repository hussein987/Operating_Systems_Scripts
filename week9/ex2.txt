To increase hit/miss ratio, we should increas ethe number of hits. To do so, we can put a sequence that contains only one number:

EX. 2 2 2  ....  2 2  2 {n-times}

And this will give us 1 miss and n hits.

=> hit/miss = n

To decrease the ratio we can increase the number of misses. To do so, we construct for example an increasing sequence.

EX. 1 2 3 4 5 6

will give 6 misses and 0 hits.

=> hit/miss = 0
